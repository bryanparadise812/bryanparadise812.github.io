                <p>
                    C++ is a general purpose programming
                    language and widely used now a days '
                    for competitive programming. It has
                    imperative, object-oriented and generic
                    programming features. C++ runs on lots of
                    platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
                    C++ is an efficient
                    and powerful language and finds wide use
                    in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
                    real-time simulations. Because of the
                    inclusion of rich function libraries,
                    working in C++ becomes simpler and
                    convenient than C. Being object-oriented
                    programming like Java, C++ provides
                    the support of inheritance, polymorphism,
                    encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows
                    exception handling and function overloading.

                    and the functions that operate on them
                    so that no other part of the code can
                    access this data except that function.

                    leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.
                    It is a user-defined data type, which holds its
                    own data members and member functions, which can
                    be accessed & used by creating an instance
                    of that class. A class is like a blueprint for
                    an object. For Example: Consider the Class
                    of Cars. There may be many cars with different
                    names and brand but all of them will share
                    some common properties like all of them will
                    have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc.
                    So here, Car is the class and wheels,
                    speed limits, mileage are their properties.

                    The capability of a class to derive
                    properties and characteristics from
                    another class is called Inheritance.
                    Inheritance is one of the most important
                    feature of Object Oriented Programming.
                    Sub Class: The class that inherits
                    properties from another class
                    is called Sub class or Derived Class.
                    Super Class: The class whose properties
                    are inherited by sub class is called Base
                    Class or Super class. Using inheritance, we
                    have to write the functions only one time
                    instead of three times as we
                    have inherited rest of the three classes
                    from base class(Vehicle).

                    The word polymorphism means having many
                    forms. In simple words, we can define
                    polymorphism as the ability of a message
                    to be displayed in more than one form.
                    A real-life example of polymorphism, a
                    person at the same time can have
                    different characteristics.
                    Like a man at the same time is a father,
                    a husband, an employee. So the same
                    person posses different behavior in
                    different situations. This is called
                    polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
                    as one of the important features of Object
                    Oriented Programming.

                    Data abstraction is one of the most
                    essential and important feature of object

                    means displaying only essential information
                    and hiding the details. Data abstraction
                    refers to providing only essential information
                    about the data to the outside world,
                    hiding the background details or implementation.

                    or applying brakes will stop the car but he
                    does not know about how on pressing accelerator
                    the speed is actually increasing, he does
                    not know about the inner mechanism of the car
                    or the implementation of accelerator, brakes
                    etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.

                    implement Abstraction in C++ using classes.
                    Class helps us to group data members and member
                    functions using available access specifiers. A
                    Class can decide which data member will be
                    visible to outside
                    world and which is not.

                    more type of abstraction in C++ can be
                    header files. For example, consider the
                    pow() method present in math.h header file.
                    Whenever we need to calculate power of a
                    number, we simply call the
                    function pow() present in the math.h header
                    file and pass the numbers as arguments
                    without knowing the underlying algorithm
                    according to which the function is actually
                    calculating power of numbers.

                <header>
                    Encapsulation
                </header>
                <p>
                    In normal terms Encapsulation is defined
                    as wrapping up of data and information
                    under a single unit. In Object Oriented
                    Programming, Encapsulation is defined as
                    binding together the data and the functions
                    that manipulates them. Consider
                    a real life example
                    of encapsulation, in a company there are
                    different sections like the accounts section,
                    finance section, sales section etc. The finance
                    section handles all the financial transactions
                    and keep records of all the data related to
                    finance.
                    Similarly the sales section handles all the
                    sales related activities and keep records of
                    all the sales. Now there may arise a situation
                    when for some reason an official from finance
                    section needs all the data about sales in a
                    particular
                    month. In this case, he is not allowed to
                    directly access the data of sales section.
                    He will first have to contact some other
                    officer in the sales section and then
                    request him to
                    give the particular data. This is what
                    encapsulation is. Here the data of
                    sales section and the
                    employees that can manipulate them are
                    wrapped under a single name “sales section”.
                </p>
  
                <p>
                    Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction
                    or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides
                    the data. In the above example the data of
                    any of the section like sales, finance or
                    accounts is hidden from any other section.<br>
                    In C++ encapsulation
                    can be implemented using Class
                    and access modifiers.
